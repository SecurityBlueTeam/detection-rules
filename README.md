Welcome to the Security Blue Team Sigma Rules Public Repository!

Our mission is to build a collaborative community of detection engineers dedicated to sharing and improving Sigma rules. By contributing to this repository, you can help others enhance their threat detection capabilities and foster a more secure digital environment.

In addition to community contributions, this repository will also host Sigma rules referenced in our blogs, labs, and other resources.
